Investigate a Dataset:- TMDb Movie
Overview
This dataset was cleaned and provided by Udacity, which was originally sourced from Kaggle by an engineer scraping the TMDb database. 
The dataset contains 5000+ movies with some metrics that measured can be classified how successful these movies are. 

For this project, I analyzed the TMDb movie dataset by using a Python Jupyter notebook which can be found in this repository.

I follow the CRISP-DM methodology of structuring a data analysis project, which splits the report into sections:
Determine Objectives and Assess the Situation
	Outline of Steps
	What are the Desired Outputs
	What Resources are Available?
	What Questions Are We Trying to Answer?
Data Wrangling and Understanding
	Data Description and Extraction
	Describe the Data's General Properties
	Verify Data Quality
	Missing Data
	Outliers
	Duplicates
	Data Summary Report
Data Cleansing
Exploratory Data Analysis
